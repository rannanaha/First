# First
My first Repositorty! Yippee Hooray!

My name is Kevin, and I like to party. 
I want to learn programming to make phat $$$taxxx.
Just kidding, I hate people who talk like that.
But really, getting paid is pretty neat. I got bills, man.

I want to learn about the wonderful world of open source programming because I would like to do things that have an effect on other people.

Okay goodbye now.
